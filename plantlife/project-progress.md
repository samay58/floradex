# ðŸŽ® Floradex Development Log

## Overview

Floradex (formerly PlantLife) is an iOS app that combines plant identification with a retro GameBoy-styled interface. It allows users to identify plants using their camera and build a collection of pixel-art plant sprites in a PokÃ©dex-inspired interface.

## Recent Implementations

### UI Components

1. **PixelGauge**
   - Created circular gauge similar to GameBoy HP meters
   - Composed of small square "pixels" for retro feel
   - Replaced standard progress bars with pixelated ring
   - Used for confidence display in identification results

2. **PhysicsTagChip**
   - Implemented UIKit-based tag chips with real physics
   - Used `UIDynamicAnimator` with attachment behavior
   - Added spring-loaded wobble effect when selected
   - Incorporated haptic feedback on selection

3. **DexCard Animations**
   - Added 3D flip animation for cards (Y-axis rotation)
   - Used spring easing for authentic "trading card" feel
   - Trigger light haptic feedback when card settles

4. **GameBoy Screen Background**
   - Created authentic 4-color dithered pattern for dark mode
   - Used CoreGraphics to generate the pixel pattern
   - Implemented classic GameBoy green palette

5. **Chip Ribbon Navigation**
   - Replaced segmented control with chip-style ribbon
   - Added animated pixel underline that slides between tabs
   - Used `matchedGeometryEffect` for smooth transitions

6. **GameBoyCameraFrame**
   - Created a 4:3 aspect ratio frame with retro styling
   - Added vignette and noise texture for retro feel
   - Integrated with camera controls for cohesive UX

7. **DexCardPager**
   - Replaced TabView with custom spring-animation pager
   - Implemented card-peel animation with 3D rotation
   - Created depth effect with scaling during transitions
   - Added pixel-style page indicators

### Architectural Improvements

1. **Camera UI**
   - Integrated camera with GameBoy-style frame
   - Added haptic feedback for all interactions
   - Improved flash control and button styling
   - Enhanced transitions with spring animations

2. **Detail View Navigation**
   - Replaced tab navigation with interactive card paging
   - Cards slide with 3D rotation and spring physics
   - Improved performance by only rendering visible cards
   - Maintained backward compatibility with feature flag

3. **SwiftUI + UIKit Integration**
   - Successfully bridged UIKit for physics where SwiftUI was limiting
   - Used `UIViewRepresentable` for seamless integration

## Current State

The app now features a consistent retro GameBoy aesthetic while maintaining modern iOS functionality:

- **Identification Flow**: Take photo â†’ Get identification â†’ Add to Floradex collection
- **Collection View**: Grid of GameBoy-styled cards with pixel sprites
- **Detail View**: Card-peel pager with authentic GameBoy styling
- **Camera View**: Retro-styled camera frame with consistent UI controls
- **Filter System**: Physics-based tag chips that wobble when selected
- **Dark Mode**: Authentic GameBoy dithered screen background

## Next Steps

1. **Animation Refinements**
   - Fine-tune spring constants based on user feedback
   - Add pixel-art success animations on identification
   - Implement 8-bit style confetti for new entries

2. **Sound Design**
   - Add optional GameBoy-style sound effects
   - Create haptic+sound combos for important actions

3. **Testing & Performance**
   - Complete snapshot tests for UI components
   - Optimize rendering performance for card pager on older devices
   - Add accessibility improvements

4. **UI Polish**
   - Add pixel border effects for card highlights
   - Improve contrast for dark mode elements
   - Create GameBoy-style loading indicators

5. **Retro Filters**
   - Add optional GameBoy-style filter for plant photos
   - Create "Press Start" animation for app launch

## Technical Notes

- The physics-based animations provide a modern feel while maintaining the retro aesthetic
- CoreGraphics is used to dynamically generate the dither patterns
- Matchmaking with specific colors helps maintain design consistency
- Haptic feedback and transitions are carefully timed to feel natural
