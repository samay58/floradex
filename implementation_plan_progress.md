# PlantLife Implementation Plan

## ‚úÖ Completed
- Migrated from Core Data to SwiftData for all persistence.
- Refactored `SpeciesDetails` to be a SwiftData `@Model` and `Codable`.
- Created `SpeciesRepository` for all data persistence and caching.
- Updated app entry to use `ModelContainer` and inject repository.
- Replaced all API aggregation with a single GPT-4o call for plant details (Wikipedia, Trefle, USDA disabled).
- Improved fallback logic: always provide GPT-4o fun facts and summary if other data is missing.
- Enhanced InfoCardView:
  - Modern, animated, and elegant UI (inspired by ChatGPT/Perplexity).
  - Animated, non-basic bullet points.
  - Segmented control with icons for Quick/Care/More tabs.
  - Consistent, beautiful typography and layout.
- Improved ContentView:
  - Modern toolbar, image viewer with gestures, and animated transitions.
  - Elegant empty state and loading overlays.
  - Camera and permissions overlays are now optional and safely handled.
- Fixed all compile errors:
  - Removed duplicate `InfoRow`.
  - Fixed ContentView initialization and argument passing.
  - Made `imageService` accessible where needed.
  - Ensured all optionals are safely handled.

## üü° In Progress / Next Up
- Add or re-enable CameraView and PermissionsOverlay if/when those features are ready.
- Further polish InfoSheetView and other secondary screens.
- Add more haptic feedback and micro-interactions.
- Continue to profile and optimize for performance and accessibility.
- Expand test coverage and add more SwiftUI previews.

## üìù Notes
- The app is now robust, modern, and visually outstanding.
- All major architectural and UI/UX upgrades are complete.
- Ready for further polish, user testing, and feature expansion.
