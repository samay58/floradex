# Floradex Project Progress Tracker

## Session Log

### Session 2 - May 29, 2025
**Duration**: 1h 12m 44s  
**Cost**: $12.12  
**Changes**: +1077 lines, -328 lines

#### Completed Tasks
1. **Camera Implementation Overhaul**
   - Redesigned camera view from constrained square to full-screen experience
   - Added photo library button in bottom-left corner (iOS standard)
   - Implemented large green capture button matching app theme
   - Fixed camera session management and capture flow
   - Added white flash animation on capture
   - Improved permission handling with inline requests

2. **Detail View Complete Redesign**
   - Switched from NavigationLink to fullScreenCover for immersive experience
   - Created floating header with parallax scrolling effect
   - Implemented tab-based navigation (Overview, Care, Growth)
   - Fixed content scrolling issues - no more cut-off text
   - Added glass-morphism effects on controls
   - Implemented staggered entrance animations
   - Added haptic feedback throughout

3. **Foundation Work**
   - Created AnimationConstants.swift with signature timing curves
   - Enhanced HapticManager with camera-specific feedback
   - Fixed navigation state management issues
   - Improved error logging and debugging

#### Key Decisions
- Full-screen modals provide better immersion than push navigation
- Tab navigation works better than card paging for detail content
- Glass morphism creates depth without heavy shadows
- Spring animations feel more natural than linear transitions

#### Technical Insights
- SwiftUI's navigation system has quirks - fullScreenCover more reliable
- Haptic feedback dramatically improves perceived app quality
- Proper spacing and typography are crucial for modern feel
- Content must be readable first, effects second

### Session 3 - May 29, 2025 (Later)
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Focus**: Bug fixes, animations, search/filter UI, and performance optimizations

#### Completed Tasks
1. **Fixed InfoCardView Compilation Errors**
   - Fixed InfoRow component reference to use PlantInfo.InfoRow
   - Removed duplicate InfoRow struct definition
   - Fixed optional value handling with null coalescing
   - Resolved all 5 compilation errors

2. **Addressed Xcode Debugger Issues**
   - Provided solutions for "Failed to attach to pid" error
   - Cleared simulator cache and derived data
   - Reset CoreSimulator service

3. **Phase 2.1: Collection Grid Polish (COMPLETED)**
   - Re-enabled breathing animations for card sprites with performance optimizations
   - Added dynamic breathing scale variation (2-4% per card)
   - Enhanced long-press preview with shadow scaling
   - Implemented new card celebration effect with shimmer
   - Added velocity-based scrolling with natural momentum
   - Implemented perspective tilt based on scroll position (max 2Â°)
   - Added wave effect for cards based on scroll velocity
   - **NEW**: Implemented memory-efficient image caching with NSCache
   - **NEW**: Added predictive image loading (prefetches 2-3 screens ahead)
   - **NEW**: Added animated sort transitions with scale/opacity effects
   - **NEW**: Implemented batch selection mode with checkboxes

4. **Phase 2.2: Search & Filter Experience (COMPLETED)**
   - Created SearchFilterView component with morphing animations

#### Session End State
- Phase 2.1 and 2.2 are now COMPLETE
- All planned features for collection grid are implemented
- Fixed compilation errors with DexGrid selection mode
- Ready to move to Phase 3: Identification Flow Excellence

#### Known Issues - FIXED
- âœ… Plant card navigation not working - FIXED: Removed conflicting onTapGesture from DexCard, moved tap handler to parent gridItem with contentShape(Rectangle()) to ensure entire area is tappable

#### Bug Fix Details
- **Issue**: Tapping plant cards provided haptic feedback but didn't navigate to detail view
- **Root Cause**: DexCard had its own onTapGesture that was intercepting taps before they reached DexGrid's navigation handler
- **Solution**: 
  1. Removed onTapGesture from DexCard component
  2. Moved tap handling to gridItem in DexGrid
  3. Added contentShape(Rectangle()) to make entire card area tappable
  4. Added debugging print statements to verify tap handling

---

#### Additional Improvements
- **Tag System Overhaul**: 
  - Created TagGenerator utility to generate meaningful tags based on plant characteristics
  - Tags now include: care difficulty ("Easy Care"), light requirements ("Low Light"), plant type ("Succulent"), common names
  - Replaced redundant genus-only tags with informative categories
  - Updated ClassificationViewModel to generate tags when creating new entries
  - Modified DexCard to display the most relevant tag using TagGenerator.primaryTag()
  - Tags help users quickly understand plant care requirements at a glance
