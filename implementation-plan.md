# Floradex UI/UX Refresh Implementation Plan

## Vision
Transform Floradex from a minimalist plant identification app into a whimsical, delightful experience that captures the magic of Pokemon while maintaining elegant, modern UX standards inspired by top-tier applications like Vercel and ChatGPT.

## Core Design Principles
1. **Whimsy & Delight** - Every interaction should spark joy
