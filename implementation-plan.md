#### Living Card Animations
- [x] **Idle Breathing**: Subtle scale oscillation for sprites (1.0 ± 0.03)
- [ ] **Magnetic Interactions**: Cards gently repel during drag operations
- [x] **Long-Press Preview**: Scale to 1.05 with shadow growth and haptic
- [x] **New Card Celebration**: Gold shimmer effect for 3 seconds on new additions

#### Smart Grid Features
- [x] **Velocity-Based Scrolling**: Natural momentum with proper deceleration
- [x] **Perspective Tilt**: Subtle 3D rotation based on scroll position (max 2°)
- [x] **Contextual Sorting**: Animated sort transitions with card shuffling
- [x] **Batch Selection**: Multi-select mode with checkbox animations

### Phase 2.2: Search & Filter Experience (COMPLETED ✅)

#### Morphing Filter Interface

## 🛠 Technical Debt & Improvements

### Immediate Fixes Needed
1. **Navigation State**: Clean up NavigationView vs NavigationStack usage - IN PROGRESS
2. **Memory Management**: ✅ DONE - Implemented ImageCacheManager with NSCache
3. **Error Handling**: Consistent error UI across all screens
4. **Test Coverage**: Add UI tests for critical paths
5. **Navigation Bug**: ✅ FIXED - Plant card tap now correctly navigates to detail view
6. **Tag System**: ✅ IMPROVED - Tags now show meaningful categories instead of redundant genus names

### Architecture Improvements
1. **View Model Consolidation**: Reduce redundant view models
2. **Dependency Injection**: Proper DI for services
3. **Async/Await Migration**: Update remaining callback-based code
4. **SwiftData Optimization**: Better query performance

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Current Performance
- **Frame Rate**: ~60fps (target: 120fps on ProMotion)
- **Memory Usage**: Acceptable (needs profiling)
- **Crash Rate**: Unknown (needs analytics)
- **User Retention**: No data yet

### Quality Targets
- [ ] All animations at 120fps on iPhone 13 Pro+
- [ ] < 100ms interaction response time
- [ ] < 500MB memory with 100+ plants
- [ ] 100% VoiceOver accessible

## 🎨 Design System Status

### Completed
- ✅ Color system with dark mode support
- ✅ Typography scale with dynamic type
- ✅ Spacing and sizing metrics
- ✅ Corner radius standards
- ✅ Animation timing curves

### In Progress
- 🔄 Component library documentation
- 🔄 Interaction patterns guide
- 🔄 Accessibility guidelines

### Planned
- 📅 Design tokens export

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Full-screen modals** over push navigation for immersive details
2. **Tab-based content** over paging for detail organization  
3. **Glass morphism** for modern depth without heavy shadows
4. **Spring animations** throughout for natural motion

### Lessons Learned
1. SwiftUI navigation is complex - fullScreenCover works better than NavigationLink for some flows
2. Haptic feedback dramatically improves perceived quality
3. Staggered animations prevent overwhelming the user
4. Content-first design - ensure text is readable before adding effects

### Next Session Goals
1. Implement living card animations in the grid
2. Add pull-to-refresh with custom animation
3. Optimize scroll performance for large collections
4. Begin search/filter UI implementation
