# Project Overview
Develop a SwiftUI iOS application that identifies plant species from user-provided photos. The app utilizes a combination of local Core ML models and external APIs (PlantNet and GPT-4o) to determine plant species, presenting the results in an interactive, haptic-rich card interface.

# Technologies and Frameworks
- SwiftUI for UI development.
- Core ML for on-device machine learning.
- Combine for reactive programming.
- AVFoundation and PhotosUI for image capture and selection.
- Core Data with NSPersistentCloudKitContainer for data persistence.
- Firebase Crashlytics for crash reporting.
- Lottie for animations.
- UINotificationFeedbackGenerator for haptic feedback.

# Coding Standards
- Adhere to Swift 5.10 conventions.
- Use camelCase for variable and function names; PascalCase for type names.
- Prefer structs over classes unless reference semantics are required.
- Utilize SwiftUI's declarative syntax for UI components.
- Implement Combine publishers for asynchronous data handling.

# UI/UX Guidelines
- Design a minimalist and intuitive interface inspired by ChatGPT and Granola AI notes UI.
- Implement a card stack UI where the top card displays the plant image and the bottom card shows identification results and care information.
- Use pastel color palettes with clean white backgrounds; accent colors should correspond to plant categories.
- Incorporate subtle animations and haptic feedback to enhance user interaction.

# Image Processing Workflow
1. Allow users to capture a new photo or select one from the photo library.
2. Process the image through:
   a. A local Core ML model trained on Flora Incognita data.
   b. PlantNet REST API.
   c. GPT-4o Vision API.
3. Aggregate the results using a majority vote mechanism, breaking ties by average confidence scores.

# Data Handling
- Fetch plant care information from Wikipedia REST API and USDA PLANTS JSON feeds.
- Normalize and cache this data using Core Data for offline access.
- Ensure all network requests are performed asynchronously with proper error handling.

# Accessibility
- Ensure all UI elements are accessible with VoiceOver.
- Provide descriptive labels for images and interactive elements.
- Support Dynamic Type for text scaling.

# Performance Optimization
- Optimize image processing to minimize latency.
- Cache API responses to reduce redundant network calls.
- Profile the app using Xcode Instruments to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

# Testing and Deployment
- Write unit tests for all critical components.
- Use TestFlight for beta distribution.
- Monitor app performance and crashes using Firebase Crashlytics.

# Cursor AI Behavior
- Prioritize code clarity and maintainability.
- When generating code, include comments explaining the purpose and functionality.
- Before making significant changes, outline a brief plan or rationale.
- Continuously update this `.cursorrules` file with new insights and decisions as the project evolves.
